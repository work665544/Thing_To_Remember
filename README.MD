## History

### World War II
	
	- Alan Turing Machine
		Movie: The Imitation Game (2014)
		Book: Alan Turing The Enigma

### Astronomy

	- A brief history of time (Stephen Hawking)
	- Astrophysics for people in a hurry

### Almanac (Geographical Location Calculation on Earth with the help of planets and stars)
	- Globally used by shipping firms

	- Our Earth is 23% tild from its original axes. This is why we observe seasons on earth.

### Nuclear Reactor (Chernobyl Disaster Zone) Russia

	- The process of the nuclear reaction in the nuclear reactor. 
	- The main part of the nuclear reactor is the nuclear reactor core which is mainly consist of three things.
		1. Fuel Rods
			- It is basically nuclear fuel, which causes a nuclear reactions. In this case, Uranium Dioxode enriched with uranium 235 isotopes.
			- Atom is built of electrons, neutrons, and protons. And each element has a different number of electrons, neutron and protons. Several elements have isotopes as well. 
			- Isotopes are basically a type of variations in the elements, in different isotopes, the number of proton remains the same, but they have different number of neutrons.
			- There are some isotopes, of some elements, that can undergo the nuclear fusion reactions.
			- Uranium 235 is an isotopes of uranium which premits nuclear fusion reaction and create nuclear energy.
			- Uranium isotopes is unstable due to which it falls apart and released radiations which is known as nuclear fission reaction.
			- Nuclear fission is process of splitting one atom into two and a few extra lonesome neutons are formed. Additionally it released kenitic energy as well that converts into thermal energy which is later goes on to move turbine.
			- The extra neutrons that are released go and collide with more atoms and such disintegration continues is known as chain reactions.
		2. Control Rods
			It is used to slow down nuclear chain reaction. In this case, the control rods were made of boron carbide. Boron is an element which absorbs neutrons quite well.
		3. Moderator
			It is used to speed-up nuclear reaction which is made-up of graphite block.
