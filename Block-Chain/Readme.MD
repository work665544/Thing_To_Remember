### Block Chain

There are two types of block chain developer.

1. Core Block Chain Developer.
2. Block Chain Application Developer.

## Core Block Chain Developer

It is responsible to create block chain client.

There are multiple types of block chain client.

1. Bitcoin
2. Ethereum
3. Ripple

There are hundered of block chain client available. So, those who work on these blockchain clients, on their protocols, on their proof of work, on their tax tech; basically, their core coding which is in multiple languages such as C++, Golang, Rust, etc.

## Block Chain Application Developer

Ninthy percent developer are block chain application developer. Their job is to make an applicaton on the existing blockchain, which we call Decentralized Applications.

### Passive Income

Blockchain can help to make passive incomes through blockchain development apart from jobs such as

Flash Loan
Trading Bots
DeFi


### Blockchain Development Prerequsits

Mathmetics and Cryptography
Web Development
    - NodeJS

### Blockchain Tools

The core of the blockchain is called smart contracts. The code written in blockchain is smart contracts. 

Blockchain application developers creates applications on blockchain. The application that they make are decentralized applications and their code is written on smart contracts. Those smart contracts are hosted on your blockchain, on that decentralized network. And the code that you write is in a language called SOLIDITY.

So it is require to learn solidity.

### SOLIDITY Language

The solidity language is almost like Javascript. There are also a things that are different from Javascript. 

### Blockchain Network

Blockchain contract are host on ethereum blockchain network which as known as Ethereum Virtual Machine. but it can't host on main Etherum blockchain. A development network such as ganache is avaible to deploy contracts for testing.

### Blockchain Development Network

A Ganache helps in setting locally ethereum network which can mimic like a main net of ethereum network. 

### Smart Contract Build Tool Truffle

Truffle is a block chain coding enviroment built-tool. It contains boiler-plat code and can used to built n deploy smart contracts.

### Website Front-End Applications to Intract With User

A website or frontend get in contact with the blockchain network as it will not contact directly. A libaray is required which is web3.js through which your frontend can communicate with your blockchain network.


### MetaMask Gateway

Web Applications that runs on browsers do not support transactions directly on ethereum blockchain and for that thet need a gateway which is metamask. Its your gateway or know as wallet.

Metamask extension can be installed in your browsers.


### Blockchain Resources

1. Coursea
    - Blockchain foundation and use cases.
    - Youtube (Dapp University)


### RoadMap

Blockchain (1-12)
Crypto-currency
Ethereum (1-12)
Solidity

### Blockchain Theory

Mempool
    -   Store transactions
    -   It consist of group of miners to pick the transaction and try to create a block by solving it mathametical problem called proof of work.

Byzantine Generals Problem

It is a problem that can be seen in distributed computing.

Consensus Protocol

    -Hashing Algorithm
    -Immutable Ledger
    -Mining
    -Distribute P2P network

Consensus protocol protect in two ways

    -Prevent Attacks
    -Competing Chain Problem

Types of Consensus Protocols

    -Proof of Work (POW)
    -Proof of Stake (POS)
    -Others

How Minig Works

    -Nonce: The nonce is a number that blockchain miners are solving for.
    -Target
        - It is a number used in mining.
        - It is a number that a block hash must be below for the block to be added on to the blockchain.
        - The target adjusts every 2016 blocks (roughly two weeks) to try and ensure that blocks are mined once every 10 minutes on average.
